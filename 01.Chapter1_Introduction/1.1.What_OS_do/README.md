# What Operating Systems Do

## Overview of Operating Systems

An operating system (OS) is the primary program running continuously on a computer, often referred to as the **kernel**. It coordinates the use of hardware among various programs and ensures the efficient operation of the system. Alongside the kernel, there are two additional categories of programs:

### 1. System Programs
These programs are associated with the operating system but do not necessarily form part of the kernel.  
**Examples:**
- **Device Drivers**: Enable communication between the OS and hardware devices (e.g., printer drivers, graphics drivers).
- **File Management Utilities**: Tools for managing files on the system (e.g., Windows File Explorer, macOS Finder).
- **System Monitoring Tools**: Software for monitoring system performance (e.g., Task Manager, Resource Monitor).

### 2. Application Programs
These include all other software that is not directly tied to the operation of the system itself.  
**Examples:**
- **Productivity Software**: Programs used for document creation and management (e.g., Microsoft Word, Google Docs).
- **Web Browsers**: Software for accessing the internet (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
- **Media Players**: Applications for playing audio and video files (e.g., VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player).

## Operating Systems in Mobile Devices

In mobile environments, operating systems are evolving to include a wider range of features. Besides the core kernel, mobile OSs typically incorporate **middleware**—a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers. Notable examples include:
- **Apple's iOS**
- **Google's Android**

### Kernel
The kernel is the central component of an operating system. It manages system resources, facilitating communication between hardware and software. It operates at a low level, interacting directly with the hardware to perform tasks such as:
- Managing memory
- Processing inputs
- Executing applications

### Middleware
Middleware serves as a bridge between the kernel and application programs. It offers various services and functionalities to application developers, such as:
- **API Management**
- **Data Management**
- **Application Services**

This allows developers to focus on building application logic without worrying about the underlying hardware complexities.

## User View
The user’s perspective of a computer system varies with the interface being used.
- **Personal Computers**: Emphasizes user-friendliness, performance, and functionality.
- **Mobile Devices**: Tailored for touch interfaces, connectivity, and efficient battery use.
- **Embedded Systems**: Minimal or no user interaction, focusing on autonomous operations (e.g., home appliances).

## System View

From a system perspective, the OS functions as a resource allocator:
- Allocates essential resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to various applications.
- Acts as a control program, ensuring proper hardware utilization by user programs, especially during I/O operations, while preventing errors or misuse.

## Why Study Operating Systems?

Understanding operating systems is vital for several reasons:
- **Foundation of Programming**: Almost all software runs on top of an operating system. Knowledge of OS fundamentals is essential for writing efficient and secure code.
- **Hardware Interaction**: Operating systems manage hardware resources, and understanding this relationship helps in optimizing application performance.
- **Efficient Programming**: Awareness of how an OS functions enables developers to create applications that utilize system resources effectively and avoid common pitfalls.
