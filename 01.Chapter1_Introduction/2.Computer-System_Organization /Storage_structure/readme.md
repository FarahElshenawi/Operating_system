# Storage Structure

In a computer system, the storage structure plays a crucial role in executing programs and managing data. The CPU can only load instructions from memory, necessitating that programs be loaded into memory before execution. This section outlines the various types of memory and storage systems within a computer.

## Memory Types

1. **Main Memory (RAM)**
   - **Definition**: Rewritable memory used to run programs.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Volatile: Loses content when power is turned off.
     - Commonly implemented as Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM).

2. **Nonvolatile Memory (NVM)**
   - **Purpose**: Retains data when power is lost.
   - **Examples**:
     - **EEPROM**: Used for bootstrapping and storing essential programs.
     - **Other firmware**: Stores infrequently changed data.

## Basic Units of Storage

- **Bit**: The smallest unit of storage, can be 0 or 1.
- **Byte**: 8 bits; smallest convenient chunk of storage.
- **Word**: Native data unit of a computer, consisting of one or more bytes (e.g., a 64-bit word on a 64-bit system).

## Storage Measurement

- **Units**:
  - **Kilobyte (KB)**: 1,024 bytes
  - **Megabyte (MB)**: 1,024² bytes
  - **Gigabyte (GB)**: 1,024³ bytes
  - **Terabyte (TB)**: 1,024⁴ bytes
  - **Petabyte (PB)**: 1,024⁵ bytes

- **Networking Measurements**: Often expressed in bits, as networks move data one bit at a time.

## Memory Operations

- **Load Instruction**: Moves data from main memory to CPU registers.
- **Store Instruction**: Transfers data from registers back to main memory.

## Instruction Execution Cycle

The typical instruction-execution cycle in a von Neumann architecture involves the following steps:
1. Fetch an instruction from memory and store it in the instruction register.
2. Decode the instruction.
3. Fetch operands from memory and store them in internal registers.
4. Execute the instruction using the operands.
5. Store the result back in memory.

## Secondary Storage

- **Definition**: An extension of main memory, allowing for the permanent storage of large quantities of data.
- **Common Devices**:
  - Hard-disk drives (HDDs)
  - Nonvolatile memory (NVM)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Slower than main memory.
  - Crucial for storing both programs and data.

## Storage Hierarchy

The various storage types can be organized into a hierarchy based on speed and capacity. The hierarchy generally follows this structure:

| Level                   | Speed          | Capacity      |
|-------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Registers                | Fastest        | Smallest      |
| Cache                    | Faster         | Small         |
| Main Memory              | Moderate       | Moderate      |
| Nonvolatile Memory       | Faster than HDDs| Moderate to Large |
| Hard-Disk Drives (HDDs) | Slow           | Large         |
| Magnetic Tapes          | Slowest        | Largest       |

## Types of Nonvolatile Storage

1. **Mechanical Storage**:
   - Examples: HDDs, optical disks, magnetic tape.
   - Generally larger and less expensive per byte.

2. **Electrical Storage**:
   - Examples: Flash memory, SSDs, FRAM, NRAM.
   - Typically smaller, faster, and more costly than mechanical storage.

## Conclusion

The design of a complete storage system must balance speed, capacity, and cost. Each storage type serves its purpose within the system, contributing to the overall performance and functionality of the operating system. Understanding the characteristics and operations of various storage types is essential for efficient resource management in computer systems. As technology evolves, the integration of faster and more efficient storage solutions will continue to impact user experience and system performance.
