# Operating Systems structure

An operating system provides the environment within which programs are executed. Internally, operating systems vary greatly in their makeup, since they are organized along many different lines. The design of a new operating system is a major task, and it is essential that the goals of the system are well-defined before the design begins. These goals form the basis for decisions among various algorithms and strategies.

Operating systems can be viewed from several vantage points:

1. **Services provided by the system.**
2. **Interfaces available to users and programmers.**
3. **Components and their interconnections.**

In this chapter, we will explore all three aspects of operating systems, highlighting the viewpoints of users, programmers, and operating system designers. We will discuss the services an operating system provides, how they are provided, how they are debugged, and the various methodologies used to design such systems. Finally, we will describe how operating systems are created and how a computer boots up its operating system.

## Chapter Objectives

- **Identify services provided by an operating system.**
- **Illustrate how system calls are used to provide operating system services.**
- **Compare and contrast monolithic, layered, microkernel, modular, and hybrid strategies for designing operating systems.**
- **Illustrate the process for booting an operating system.**
- **Apply tools for monitoring operating system performance.**
- **Design and implement kernel modules for interacting with a Linux kernel.**
