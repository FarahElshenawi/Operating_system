# üìö Operating Systems - My Learning Journey

Welcome to my Operating Systems learning repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my personal journey as I explore and learn key concepts of operating systems. Here, you'll find my notes, resources, and important details as I progress through each topic.

## üìù Objectives of My Learning Journey
- **Understand the Role of the Operating System:** Explore how OS functions as a bridge between hardware and software.
- **Learn Resource Management:** Understand how the OS manages CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- **Study Process and Memory Management:** Learn about process scheduling, memory allocation, and deallocation.
- **Understand File Systems and I/O Systems:** Learn how data is stored and retrieved through file systems.
- **Explore Security and Protection Mechanisms:** Understand how the OS ensures data security and resource protection.

## üí° Why Studying Operating Systems is Important for Me
- **Foundational Knowledge for Computer Engineering:** Operating systems are the backbone of all computing systems, essential for my growth as a software engineer.
- **Enhances Problem-Solving Skills:** Understanding OS concepts will sharpen my ability to troubleshoot and optimize systems.
- **Prepares Me for System Optimization:** Helps me understand how to make better system-level decisions to optimize performance.
- **Career Opportunities:** A strong OS foundation opens doors to roles like software engineering, system administration, DevOps, and security engineering.

## üöÄ What I Expect from This Learning Journey
- **Thorough Understanding of OS Concepts:** Through theoretical and practical work, I aim to build a solid foundation of how operating systems work.
- **Real-World Applications:** Projects that simulate key OS functionalities like process management, memory handling, and file systems.
- **Practical Coding Skills:** Experience writing programs using system calls, process scheduling, and memory management techniques.

## üéØ What I Aim to Achieve After Completing This Course
- **Proficiency in System Calls:** Ability to write programs using system calls for file handling and process management.
- **Managing Processes and Threads:** Create programs that efficiently manage process scheduling and synchronization.
- **Implementing OS Algorithms:** Implement scheduling algorithms (Round Robin, FCFS) and memory management techniques (paging, segmentation).
- **OS Performance Analysis:** Evaluate and optimize system performance using monitoring tools.
- **Understanding File Systems:** Grasp how data is stored, retrieved, and organized in file systems.

## üìö Resources I'm Using
- **YouTube Playlist:** [Operating Systems - Complete Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhwVAYxlh5dsX6aOfVMZXS8MwKwBmwVM6)
- **Book:** *Operating System Concepts* by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne

## üîß Prerequisites for My Journey
Before diving into Operating Systems, it's helpful to have:
- Basic knowledge of **programming** (preferably in C or C++).
- Familiarity with **computer hardware** (CPU, memory, etc.).
- Understanding of **data structures** (stacks, queues, trees).


## ü§ù How This Course Will Benefit Me
By the end of this journey, I will have:
- A comprehensive understanding of how operating systems work.
- Practical coding skills to write efficient and optimized programs.
- Problem-solving abilities to troubleshoot and improve system performance.
- A solid foundation to explore more advanced topics like virtualization, distributed systems, and system security.
